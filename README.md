# C_linear_algebra

These files together implement a library allowing linear algebra in C, using matrices whose elements are doubles.
"linear_base" files contain the underlying matrix structure, a function to access elements, and a function to print a matrix
"linear_baseOps" files contain operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication.
"linear_construction" files contain what are essentially constructor functions to more easily build matrices.
"linear_rowColOps" files contain functions for row and column operations.
